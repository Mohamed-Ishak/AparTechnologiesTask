Simple Test Automation Framework using Java Selenium TestNG and Cucumber 


I have created this Task using Selenium TestNG and Cucumber based on  Java Programming Language.

***********************************

I Write it using BDD style by adding a feature File for non-tech persons using a Scenario outline to change the Test data for each country in the 3 Subscription Types (Lite - Classic  - Premium)

Steps To Execute The Scenario in 3 ways 

1 - You can run it from the TestRunner Class   

2-  From the testng.xml file 

3 - Run mvn test command which can be used in pipelines like Jenkins

You will find in each Step I have added an assertion on the subscription type then I assert on the price for each subscription type in the three countries
You can add any other country and then run the code so it will be executed successfully.
